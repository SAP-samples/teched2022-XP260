# Exercise 4 - Security Recommendations regarding audit.log

In this exercise you will learn about security recommendations that help protect your accounts from risks related to the audit log.
The SAP Audit Log service is a platform service which stores all the audit logs written on your behalf by other platform services that you use. It allows you to retrieve the audit logs for your subaccount via the audit log retrieval API or view them using the SAP Audit Log Viewer service. The rention time is 90 days - there is currently no possibility to extend the retension time.
Therefore we reccommend to download regular audit logs and save them ideally in an existing and central audit log system of your choice. This can be done via the audit log retrieval API or in the SAP Audit Log Viewer service.
